## Task-based Software Engineering Assignment
For this assignment we were tasked with processing sales data from a supermarket in parallel, using C# and F#.
We were tasked with creating a C# implementation with a WinForms GUI, then had to port that implementation to F# and compare the speeds and both languages in the report.
This module taught me a lot about parallel processing and using F#, which I had not used before this module.
